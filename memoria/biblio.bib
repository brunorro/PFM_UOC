  abstract =	"Interpolating images is a very common task but many interpolation filters are designed using error metrics that, in comparison to the known human vision system, are fairly crude. In this paper a model of the human vision system is used to produce a quality score that is useful for comparing the errors due to image resampling. It is tested with a number of image resamplers. We conclude that such a model produces a measure of image quality that is superior to signal-to-error ratio, but that further refinements are necessary. 1 Image resampling problems In practical computer vision systems resampling is commonplace.  Format conversion, rectification, and warping are all operations that involve resampling. Therefore there is considerable interest in developing resampling schemes that operate with any scaling factor without user intervention. Most resampling methods assume that the original intensity distribution is correctly sampled and construct new images by linear filtering followed by ...",
